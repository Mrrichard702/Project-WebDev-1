    <!--A brief paragraph about the videogames i'm talking about-->
    <p>
      I enjoy ULTRAKILL because its like doom eternal except it has alot more
      layers to the games design. the games story is quite mankind is dead,
      blood is fuel, hell is full. and so you go through the dante's 9 layers of
      hell. the only way to heal is by being near spilt blood from enemies.
